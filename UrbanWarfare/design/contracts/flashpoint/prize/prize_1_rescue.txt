[ShortDesc]I've given your pilot a map of Men Lojowen, complete with the rough location of the Star League installation. I want you to get in there, brush aside any resistance, and loot whatever your BattleMechs can carry. You'll get your pay when my associates have the goods.

[Dialogue]Dialogue_MissionStart
	[Content]According to Corbu's map, our Star League "stapler factory" should be somewhere just ahead of you. He also said that we shouldn't run up against anything more dangerous than a combat vehicle or two, but I'd take that with a grain of salt.

	[Content]Me neither, but it's refreshing to work for someone who's <i>obviously</i> sketchy for a change. I mean, most of our clients are just as bad, but they're much better at hiding it.

	[Content]Men Lojowen is <i>my</i> island, Binton. If I catch either of you near that vault, you'll only <i>wish</i> you were dead. I've got a bucket of Proserpinan blood limpets and a vivid imagination, and I'm feeling eager to use 'em.

	[Content]Commander, I've been studying the symbols on the crates that our lance pulled from the facility. Against all odds, it looks like Mr. Corbu was telling us the truth. We've just stolen several tons of commercial-grade LosTech desk accessories.

	[Content]And to think, Binton and Modge have been at each other's throats over this vault for months. People have <i>died</i> for this. How do we break it to them they were fighting over garbage?

	[Content]It isn't our job to break anything to them. All we need to do is get this crap to Louth Abbey and get paid. Speaking of which, I'm setting a course, Commander. We'll get Corbu on the horn as soon as we reach cruising altitude.
