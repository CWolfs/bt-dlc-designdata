[ShortDesc]Commander, this installation is a vital part of Combine research efforts, and we need to ensure the enemy doesn't destroy it. We believe the opposing forces are a mercenary unit hired by our erstwhile allies in the Free Worlds League, and their intent is to disrupt the important work being done here. Your job will be to hold them off until they exhaust themselves, at which point we'll launch our own counterattack.
[LongDesc]This seems simple enough, which makes me nervous. I don't like when we're asked to defend "research" without knowing what the research is.

	[Content]To be completely honest with you, I haven't the faintest idea what kind of research goes on here. Nevertheless, a credible threat has been made. Your opposition is a mercenary company using the rather grandiose name "[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGrayDeath],Gray Death Legion]]."
