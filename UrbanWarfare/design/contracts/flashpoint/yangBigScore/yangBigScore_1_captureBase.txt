// Difficulty is one of Easy, Medium, or Hard
[Difficulty]Easy
[ShortDesc]Wallo's got a mercenary company on retainer to protect his private aerospace hangar, the imaginatively named "Security Solutions, Inc." I looked 'em up, and they're the real deal—they've got combat vehicles, BattleMechs, the works. But we'll have the element of surprise on our side, given that Wallo's never heard of us. That's something, right?
[LongDesc]Let's hope this heist works out the way Yang said that it would.
