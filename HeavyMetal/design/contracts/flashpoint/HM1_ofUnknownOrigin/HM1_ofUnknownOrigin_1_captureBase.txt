[Difficulty]Easy
[ShortDesc]According to ISF intelligence, Captain Gaku Magorian is being held prisoner in one of a dozen safe houses within the boundaries of Alamedo Province. Obviously, we can't rely on trial and error to find him, so we're going to have to narrow down the list. Our unidentified syndicate is known to maintain a forward base in this AO. Capture it so that Dr. Murad can scour the OpFor's mainframe for confirmation of Captain Magorian's whereabouts.
[LongDesc]I still can't believe that we don't even know who we're fighting against. It is what it is, I guess.

	[Content]Okay, Commander. Our unidentified crime syndicate's forward base should lie somewhere up ahead. Stick your neck out far enough and you're bound to find it.

	[Content]Yeah, and who knows what else. I probably don't have to remind you of this, Boss, but Shugo Yamaguchi couldn't tell us who these criminals are or what kind of firepower they're packing. Could just be vehicles and turrets, but I'll bet dollars to donuts they're stomping around in BattleMechs.
