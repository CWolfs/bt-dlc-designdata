// Difficulty is one of Easy, Medium, or Hard
[Difficulty]Hard
[ShortDesc]The location of the bunker is extremely well concealed, presumably to prevent exactly the kind of orbital strike we're planning to make. For us to locate it, you'll need to download transmission data from a logistics base in the region. That should give us a rough location. The logistics base is likely to be well defended, but if we're going to keep from alerting the Capellans to our plan, you'll need to insert with a lighter lance than you may be used to. Remember that all we need is the data; any enemy forces present are incidental.
[LongDesc]They may be incidental but they're going to be shooting <i>our</i> 'Mechs in the ass, Commander. We're going to need to stay on the move.
