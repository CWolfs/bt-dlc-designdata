[Difficulty]Hard
[ShortDesc]I still believe this approach is a mistake, Commander, but I'll continue to defer to your judgment. For both our sakes, let's hope you're right and that capturing this base will be a better long-term plan than simply obliterating it. The ISF reports that the facility is defended by both Davion 'Mechs and turrets, which strongly suggests there's something there worth protecting. You'll need to eliminate any hostile forces before my people can move in and sweep the base for our target.
[LongDesc]Capturing this base is going to be tough, Commander. We'll be outnumbered and possibly outgunned. I hope it's worth it.
