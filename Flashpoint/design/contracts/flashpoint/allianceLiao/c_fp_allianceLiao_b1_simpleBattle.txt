[Difficulty]Hard
[ShortDesc]Before the Maskirovka team can transport the scientists to the extraction point, we need to deal with the Davion forces that are closing on our position. We've located two lances of 'Mechs that are inbound, and I need you to intercept them before they get here. Once they're dealt with, we can start moving the team, and the scientists, to the extraction point. And Commanderâ€¦ I apologize for my curt tone earlier. I didn't brief you fully, and that was unprofessional of me.
[LongDesc]The FedSuns are going to assume we're still back at the base getting things loaded up and ready to go, Commander. Let's give them a surprise.

	[Content]That's the last of them, Commander. The field is clear. I'll signal to my Maskirovka liaison that she can start moving the scientists. We'll need to field another lance immediately as an escort for them; there's no time for resupply.

	[Content]That's it, Commander. The Maskirovka team is reporting they're under fire from Davion forces. They'll be able to extract on their own, but not with the scientists. We've failed.
