// Difficulty is one of Easy, Medium, or Hard
[Difficulty]Easy
[ShortDesc]With Lord Gurung's bodyguard in ruins, we are clear to advance on the armory he's taking refuge in. When the building is ours, I will deal with the man personally. He will pay for what his hirelings have done to my family.
[LongDesc]Singh still believes that Gurung was behind the attacks on his family. That's bad news for Gurung, but it's good for us. Let's do this thing and get paid.
